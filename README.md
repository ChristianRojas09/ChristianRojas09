Hi, my name is Christian. I am a developer based in Austin, TX.

I started learning how to code because I love the ability to not only bring code to life, but also having a deep understanding of the software and how it functions.
I have many goals. I hope to one day see full dive VR technology, and would love to work on it.
I also want to work with robots that help create a better world for the disabled community.
As a disabled person myself, I work to understand how robotics can help our community by providing assistance where it isn't now.
